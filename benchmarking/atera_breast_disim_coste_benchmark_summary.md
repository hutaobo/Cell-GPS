## Methods

The benchmark compares two readouts from the same directed matrix.

- COSTE: cluster the directed Searcher->Findee matrix in row and column directions, then convert each hierarchy to a normalized cophenetic distance matrix.
- PNAS di-sim: transform the same directed distance matrix to an affinity matrix, build the regularized directed graph Laplacian, compute top left/right singular vectors, row-normalize each embedding, and k-means cluster row and column roles.

For gene-level runs, the script uses the full 18028-gene panel as the feature universe, selects the top expressed genes for the benchmark size, bins 170057 cells into a 96 x 96 spatial grid, and constructs a directed gene->gene COSTE-style matrix as the expression-weighted mean distance from each source-gene spatial distribution to each target-gene spatial centroid.

## Interpretation

The two methods share the same mathematical object: an asymmetric matrix with separate row/source and column/target roles. di-sim factorizes a degree-regularized version of that matrix into low-dimensional row and column embeddings; COSTE turns row and column profiles into hierarchical cophenetic metric spaces. The benchmark reflects that relationship: the gene-level di-sim embedding distances correlate with COSTE cophenetic distances, but they are not interchangeable. COSTE preserves a hierarchy over the full directed profiles, while di-sim compresses those profiles into a small number of singular-vector dimensions and flat k-means labels.

Runtime separates cleanly by step. Matrix construction is dominated by reading and aggregating the full Xenium HDF5 matrix. Once the directed matrix exists, di-sim is much faster than exact COSTE cophenetic clustering at 2048 and 4096 genes. COSTE's cost grows sharply because exact row/column pairwise distances and hierarchical linkage scale with the square of item count and profile length; di-sim's truncated SVD stays comparatively cheap for the tested ranks.
